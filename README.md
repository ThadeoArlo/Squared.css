### Applying the code
download squared.css
or,
paste this line on your html code.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://arlora.co.nf/projects/libs/squared/squared.css">
Or,
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://arlora.co.nf/projects/libs/squared/squared.min.css">
```

### How to use:

All of the css classes included in this library has common characteristics:
- classes start with sq (declaring its a squared.css class) so that if you're using multiple libraries, they don't interfere.
- sq classes are followed by the class description indicating the style to be applied to the element
- sq class descriptions are seperated by one or more hyphens(-)

ex:

If you want to add a shadow effect on an header, simple add the class 'sq-textshadow' to the header element, and it will show up with a shadow.

```html
<h1 class="sq-textshadow">Hello World</h1>
```

The example above shows that the text inside the element "h1" will have a shadow effect. 

To know all the classes and what they do, you can go ahead and look at the css file,  it has comments so that you could easily understand the code.

##Customize

If you want to make some custom edits to your code or making an element unique while still having the library, you can download and customize the code to what suit you best, or simply adding an id to your element and store all the unique element css in a seperate css file named custom.css (my suggestion).
